\title{Train Model over Different Tuning Parameters}
\usage{
trainNBLDA(x, y, type = c("mle", "deseq", "quantile", "tmm"),
  tuneLength = 10, metric = c("accuracy", "error"),
  train.control = nbldaControl(), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a n-by-p data frame or matrix. Samples should be in the rows and variables in the columns. Used to train the classifier.}

\item{y}{a vector of length n. Each element corresponds to a class label of a sample. Integer and/or factor types are allowed.}

\item{type}{a character string indicating the type of normalization method within the NBLDA model. See details.}

\item{tuneLength}{a positive integer. This is the total number of levels to be used while tuning the model parameter(s).}

\item{metric}{which criteria should be used while determining the best parameter? overall accuracu or avarage number of misclassified samples?}

\item{train.control}{a list with control parameters to be used in NBLDA model. See \link{nbldaControl} for details.}

\item{...}{further arguments. Deprecated.}
}
\value{
an \code{nblda} object with following slots:
\item{input}{an \code{nblda_input} object including the raw count data and response variable. See \code{\linkS4class{nblda_input}} for details.}
\item{result}{an \code{nblda_trained} object including the results from cross-validated and final models. See \code{\linkS4class{nblda_trained}} for details.}
\item{call}{a call expression.}

\description{
This function fits Negative Binomial classifier using various model parameters and finds the best model parameter
using the resampling based performance measures.

\details{
NBLDA is proposed to classify count data from any field, e.g. economics, social sciences, genomics, etc.
In RNA-Seq studies, for example, normalization is used to adjust between-sample differences for downstream analysis.
\code{type} is used to define normalization method. Available options are "mle", "deseq", "quantile" and "tmm".
Since "deseq", "quantile" and "tmm" methods are originally proposed as robust methods to be used in RNA-Sequencing studies, one should
carefully define normalization types. In greater details, "deseq" estimates the size factors by dividing each sample by the geometric means
of the transcript counts (Anders and Huber, 2010). "tmm" trims the lower and upper side of the data by log fold changes to
minimize the log-fold changes between the samples and by absolute intensity (Robinson and Oshlack, 2010). "quantile" is
quantile normalization approach of Bullard et al (2010). "mle" (less robust) divides total counts of each sample to the grand total
counts (Witten, 2010). See related papers for mathematical backgrounds.
